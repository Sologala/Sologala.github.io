<h1 id="1-fall-in-love-with-english">1. Fall in love with English</h1>

<font color="Red">Hiding</font>
<p>behind the <font color="Blue">loose dusty curtain</font>, a <font color="Red">teenager</font> packed up his <font color="Red">overcoat</font> into the suitcase.
He planned to leave home at dusk, though there was <font color="Green">thunder</font> and lightning outdoors.
He had got to do this, because he was tired of his parent<font color="Green">'s</font> <font color="Blue">nagging</font> about his English study, and did not want to go through it any longer.
He couldn’t get along well with English, and disliked joining in English classes because he thought his teacher ignore<font color="Green">d</font> him on purpose.
As a result, his score in each exam never added up to over sixty.
His <font color="Red">partner</font> was concerned about him very much.
She understood exactly what he was suffering from, but <font color="Red">entirely</font> disagreed with <font color="Blue">his</font> idea.
In order to calm him down and sattle his problem, she talked with him face to face, and <font color="Red">swapped</font> <font color="Blue">a</font> series of learning tips with him.
The items she set <font color="Blue">down</font> <font color="Blue">helped</font> him find <font color="Blue">the</font> highway to study<font color="Green">ing</font> English well.
The <font color="Red">teenager</font> was greatful and got great power from his friend’s words.
Now, he has recovered from being upset, and has fall<font color="Green">en</font> in love with English.</p>

<ul>
  <li>curtain (英/ˈkɜːtn/ 美/ˈkɜːrtn/): n. 窗帘, <em>eg:</em> Hiding behind the loose dusty curtain</li>
  <li>nag (/ˈnæɡ/): v. 唠叨, <em>eg:</em> because he was tired of his parent’s nagging about his English study</li>
  <li>swap (英/swɒp/ 美/swɑːp/): v. 交换, <em>eg:</em> and swapped a series of learning tips with him</li>
  <li>find the highway to doing <em>sth</em>.: 找到做某事的最佳捷径, <em>eg:</em> The items she set down helped him find the highway to studying English well.</li>

<h1 id="2-different-countries-have-different-kinds-of-englishes">2. Different Countries have Different kinds of Englishes</h1>

<p>Voyages of people from England play an important part in <font color="Red">spreading</font> the English language.
At present, English is frequently spoken as an official or common language in many countries,
such as America, Singapore, <font color="Red">Malaysia</font>, and some <font color="Green">A</font>frican countries.
All based on british English, the English spoken in these contries can be well understood by native speakers.
But actually, these Englishes have been gradually changing in accent, spellings, expressions, and the usage of <font color="Red">vocabulary</font>.
Because of this fact, you can make use of the differences to tell which country the <font color="Red">foreigners</font> of your block <font color="Blue">are</font> from.
For example, if the boss fluently commands <font color="Green">his</font> driver, come up straight to my <font color="Green">a</font>partment by elevator, and take some gas <font color="Green">for</font> my <font color="Blue">trucks</font> and <font color="Blue">cabs</font>,
instead of requesting, please come to my flat by lift, and take some <font color="Blue">petrol</font> for my <font color="Blue">lorries</font> and taxis.
You can recognize <font color="Green">his</font> American identity, while the latter suggests that he is British.</p>

<p>(公寓、电梯、汽油、卡车、出租车)的差异表达：</p>
<ul>
  <li>美：come up straight to my apartment by elevator, and take some gas for my trucks and cabs</li>
  <li>英：please come to my flat by lift, and take some petrol for my lorries and taxis</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="3-a-hard-trip">3. A Hard Trip</h1>

<p>My sister was fond of travel<font color="Green">ing</font>.
Ever since graduating, she <font color="Blue">had been</font> <font color="Red">determined</font> to organize a trip to an old temple.
Since transporting <font color="Blue">fare</font> was expensive, she decided to use a bicycle to cycle there, not caring about the dis<font color="Red">ad</font>vantages.
Her <font color="Blue">stubborn</font> attitude was always her shortcoming.
Once she made up her mind to do something, no one could persuade her to change her mind.
Finally, we g<font color="Green">a</font>ve in as usual, <font color="Blue">though we</font> perfe<font color="Green">r</font>red to take a train.
After we prepared everything, including the schedule, relaible weather forecast, and <font color="Red">insurance</font>, we began our trip.
Our journey was <font color="Blue">along a</font> river flowing from the high altitu<font color="red">d</font>e.
Our pace was slow because the river frequently had many sharp <font color="Blue">bends</font> through deep valleys, while the <font color="Blue">water</font> seemed to <font color="Blue">boil</font>.
Just as I recorded in my journal, it was <font color="Green">really a</font> hard journey, but we also enjoyed great <font color="Blue">views</font>.
One night, I put my head on my pillow, a <font color="Blue">parcel</font> of <font color="Blue">wool</font> coats, and lay beneath the stars.
When the flame in front of our cave <font color="Blue">went</font> out at midnight, I found the sky so beautiful.</p>

<h1 id="4-a-horrible-earthquake">4. A Horrible Earthquake</h1>

<p>Dirty water <font color="Red">rose in</font> wells and <font color="blue">canals</font> before the earthquake.
But no one judged that <font color="green">an</font> earthquake was coming.
Suddenly, everything <font color="Red">shook</font>.
It seemed <font color="blue">as if</font> the world was at an end.
Millions of brick houses and <font color="green">a</font> number of <font color="blue">dams</font> were dist<font color="Red">ro</font>yed.
Railway tracks became useless bars.
Pipes in <font color="blue">mines</font> burst and let out smelly steam.
Huge cracks trap<font color="green">ped</font> cyclists everywhere.
The next day this event was the headline or main title of all newspapers.
With the reporters giv<font color="green">ing</font> an outline of the <font color="Red">disaster</font>, the whole nation was shocked by the damage and victim’s extrame suffering.
People were moved when they read <font color="green">that</font> the surviv<font color="red">o</font>rs <font color="blue">comforted</font> each other by saying ‘<font color="Red">Congratulations</font>! You survived.’
So they not only expressed their <font color="blue">sympathy</font> sincerely, but also organized together to help the victims right away.
The injured were <font color="Red">rescued</font> and the dead were <font color="Red">buried</font>.
The <font color="blue">frightened</font> surviv<font color="red">o</font>rs were dug out from under the ruins, and were offered shelter, fresh water and electricity.
Thanks to people’s help, the loss was minimized.</p>

<h1 id="5-the-great-president">5. The Great Pres<font color="Red">i</font>dent</h1>

<p>As the f<font color="Red">o</font>under of the Republic, the president had many good qualities.
Before coming to power, he was a <font color="blue">generous</font> law<font color="Red">y</font>er.
He was w<font color="green">i</font>lling to selflessly help everyone who turned to him.
He accepted no fee to offer legel guidences and opinions to those who <font color="green">were</font> out of work or uneducated.
Latter, believing all mankind to be equal, he devoted himself to stopping the unfair anti-black laws.
He set up the black <font color="blue">youth</font> league and was voted to be the leader.
However, though he <font color="blue">kept</font> peaceful principles without violence and terro<font color="Red">r</font>, his mean <font color="Red">enemies</font> still bl<font color="green">e</font>w up his house and attacked his relatives,
and he himself couldn’t escape being sentenced to 30 years in prison.
Not fearing of the <font color="blue">prison guards' cruelty</font>, he kept active and begged no mercy from them.
As a metter of fact, he was always hopeful and never lost heart during the stage even though he was in trouble.
Finally, people rewarded him with the leader’s <font color="blue">position</font> and <font color="green">a</font> gold blanket.</p>

<ul>
  <li>cruelty (/ˈkruːəlti/): n. 残忍, <em>eg:</em> Not fearing of the prison guards’ cruelty</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="6-a-brave-maid">6. A <font color="Red">Brave</font> Maid</h1>

<p>A wooden <font color="blue">vase</font> from the Ming dynesty at the entr<font color="Red">a</font>nce of the <font color="blue">reception</font> hall amazed everyone.
The artists designed it in <font color="green">a</font> rare style and selected valuable <font color="blue">jewels</font> to decorate it.
People thought highly of its fancy color of honey and the beautiful paintings on it.
The <font color="blue">vase</font> used to belong to <font color="green">a</font> former castle, but when the country was at war, the enemy troops exploded the castle.</p>
<font color="blue">Debates</font>
<p>on how the <font color="blue">vase</font> survived <font color="blue">went</font> on and on.
In order to remove people<font color="green">'s</font> <font color="blue">doubt</font>, a team of no less than 20 people carried out an <font color="Red">informer</font> investigation.
The evidences they found showed that <font color="green">a</font> maid took the <font color="blue">vase</font> apart and asked a <font color="Red">sailor</font> to sink <font color="green">it in</font> a local well.
She never gave away <font color="green">the</font> secret, even under the cruel <font color="Red">trial</font> of the enemies, who were in search of treasures.
It is worth giving this brave maid a <font color="Red">fortune</font> in return.</p>

<h1 id="7-a-fair-competition">7. A Fair Competition</h1>

<p>Swifter, higher and stronger, stands for the spirit of Olympics.
But fairness is the basis of this <font color="blue">motto</font>.
Only when you win fairly, will you and your homeland deserve the great glory.
But nowadays, unlike the ancient <font color="red">honest</font> <font color="blue">slave</font> competitors, some hopeless <font color="blue">athletes</font>, who can’t <font color="red">bear</font> the pain of training, cheat when taking part in games.</p>
<font color="blue">Medals</font>
<p>seem to have magic<font color="green">al</font> powers <font color="red">causing</font> them to cheat, and the price money has replace<font color="green">d</font> the <font color="blue">motto</font> as <font color="green">their</font> only goal.
So in the <font color="blue">gymnastics</font> event to be held in our city next month, 
one of the <font color="blue">host</font>’s respons<font color="green">i</font>bilities is to keep competitions fair.
They adverti<font color="green">sed</font> on posters outside the <font color="blue">stadium</font> to promi<font color="green">s</font>e that every competitor is to have <font color="green">a</font> regular physical examination in <font color="green">a</font> <font color="blue">gymnasium</font> one <font color="blue">after another</font>.
No one can <font color="red">bargain</font> on this.
The volunteers in charge will be very strict.
It is foolish to cheat because they <font color="green">will</font> not be admitted to <font color="blue">compete</font> and <font color="green">will</font> even be fine<font color="green">d</font> as well.</p>

<ul>

<h1 id="8-computers">8. Computers</h1>

<p>The goal of early calculating machines was to simplify difficult sums.
But with the help of new technology, electronic chips replaced <font color="blue">tubes</font> and <font color="green">a</font> revolution of artific<font color="red">i</font>al intelligence has <font color="blue">arisen</font>.
From then on, the appearance of computers totally changed our lives.
They can not only download the information from the net when connected by the network or mobile phone signals, but also solve different types of logical problems.
With <font color="blue">operators</font> as their coaches, they can even control rockets to explore the moon, and instruct <font color="blue">androids</font> with the human race’s characters to <font color="blue">mop floors</font> and watch over your <font color="red">naughty</font> <font color="blue">niece</font>.
Anyhow, computers are so helpful <font color="green">that</font> they do bring happiness.
However, computers are easily attacked by viruses.
This <font color="blue">reality</font> has become a hard-to-deal-with-problem.
As a result, computers are dangerous in a way.
So personally, I worry about <font color="green">their</font> universal applications in some fields, such as finance.</p>

<ul>
  <li>tube (英/tjuːb/ 美/tuːb/): n. 电子管, <em>eg:</em> electronic chips replace tubes</li>

<h1 id="9-wildlife-protection">9. Wildlife Protection</h1>

<font color="red">Dinosaurs</font>
<p>died out because of <font color="blue">an un</font>expected incident.
But wildlife today disappear<font color="green">s</font> or is in danger just because human do harm to it.
For example, tigers are hunted for fur to make carpets, so that they can only live in secure reserves.
Grassland is distroyed without mercy, so that <font color="blue">dust storms</font> come into being <font color="blue">affecting distant</font> cit<font color="green">ies</font>.
Last year, scientists saw some monkeys <font color="blue">rubbing</font> themselves with the certain kind of insects to protect themselves from <font color="blue">fierce</font> <font color="red">mosquitoes</font> <font color="red">biting</font>.
According to the result of the <font color="blue">inspection</font>, they found that insect contains a powerful drug.
So local farmers were employed to catch the insects.
The ending was that the insect disappeared from the whole <font color="blue">zone</font>.
When told that it was a los<font color="green">s</font> to humans, the farmer<font color="green">s</font> burst into laughter and responded, ``our real loss is our decreasing income.’’
We should appreciate the natural balance, and pay more attention to the importance of wildlife pretection.
Not <font color="blue">until</font> we succeed <font color="blue">in</font> letting wildlife live in peace, can we smile in <font color="blue">relief</font>.</p>

<h1 id="10-my-first-band">10. My First Band</h1>

<p>I was very sensitive to music.
Just <font color="blue">dipping</font> into the music books bri<font color="red">ef</font>ly, I could sing or play well.
To be honest, I always dreamt of <font color="blue">becoming</font> a famous <font color="blue">folk actor</font>.
I was so confident that I never decrease<font color="green">d</font> my devotion.
I formed my first band called ‘rolling frog’.
At the begin<font color="green">n</font>ing, we relyed on performing <font color="blue">on</font> instrument<font color="green">s</font> in pubs <font color="blue">or</font> to passers<font color="red">-</font>by to earn extra money in cash.
Then we <font color="blue">wore false beards</font> to pretend to be the musicians who<font color="green">m</font> people were famili<font color="green">a</font>r with.
In addition, we attached hum<font color="red">o</font>rous <font color="blue">acts</font> to our performances and played jokes on each other.
Soon, our funny jazz became famous and the inv<font color="red">i</font>tation<font color="green">s</font> to perform for <font color="red">broad</font>cast stations began to come.
Afterwards, we sorted out our att<font color="red">r</font>active music and made a record in the studi<font color="red">o</font>.
A million or so copies were sold and we became <font color="red">millionaires</font>.
It was painful that the band broke up finally, but above all I realized my dream to be a musician.</p>

<h1 id="11-an-interesting-festival">11. An Interesting Festival</h1>

<p>The <font color="red">agricultural</font> feast takes place after the independence day.
It is not a worldwild cel<font color="red">e</font>bration, only <font color="blue">Christians</font> in <font color="red">Mexico</font> look forward to its arrival <font color="blue">for its</font> religious origin.
Long ago, hum<font color="green">a</font>n’s <font color="red">ancestors</font> were bad, they fooled and played tricks on each other, and never kept their word.
So god turned up and <font color="blue">drowned</font> all their crops.
Hum<font color="green">ans</font> <font color="blue">starved</font> day and night, weeping.
In order to gain god’s forgiveness, a woman <font color="blue">poet</font> set <font color="blue">off</font> to see god.
She admired god and kept apologizing.
God was moved. With his <font color="red">permission</font>, hum<font color="green">a</font>ns finally had good <font color="blue">harvests</font> again.
So, to <font color="blue">wipe</font> sadness and remind themselves of the <font color="blue">belief</font> in god, people began the festival.
On the festival, people gather in the open air, such as playground <font color="green">or</font> parking lots, and ene<font color="red">r</font>getically have fun with each other all night long as though they were never tired.
When <font color="green">a</font> beauty dressed up in lovely clothing reads poem<font color="green">s</font> in memory of the poet, everyone holds their breath.
Then it is the custom that the <font color="blue">bone</font> of <font color="green">a</font> rooster head is given to her as <font color="blue">an award</font>.
Obviously, the story is not true, but the festival is interesting.</p>

``Both of your menus have weakness and limited strength.
Your customers put on weight too easily, while Yonghui’s lose weight too quickly.

You <font color="blue">ought to</font> combine the two menus and provide a balanced diet. ‘’

In 1956, he visited Africa, his birth place.
One day, when he was wandering on the pavement near the <font color="blue">bay</font> enjoying the sea <font color="blue">scenes</font>, he lost his money and passport that he kept in an env<font color="red">e</font>lope.

But the <font color="blue">ambassador</font> with rude manners didn’t <font color="blue">promit his staff</font> to help though he <font color="blue">bowed</font> to him.
Staring at his impa<font color="red">tient</font> face, he understood that it was the fault of his <font color="blue">skin</font> colo<font color="green">u</font>r that accounted for their rejection.
So he decided to take a chance to sail on a small boat home.
He met a large <font color="green">a</font>mount of difficulty but was never stopped.
On the contrary, difficulty pushed him to go ahead harder.
Three months later, he was <font color="blue">spotted</font> by a ship by accident.
He was in rags <font color="green">in</font>deed.
A maid even screamed when bringing him a <font color="blue">steak</font> and <font color="red">pine</font>apple <font color="blue">dessert</font>.

<p>MK-II, a planet billions of k<font color="red">i</font>lometers away, is the origin of life in many religions.
Physicists have proved the theory that its gentle <font color="blue">climate</font> and the pull of its gravity are similiar to the earth’s.
And <font color="blue">astronomers</font> have found that <font color="blue">oxygen atoms</font> and carbon dioxide which are f<font color="red">u</font>ndamental to life exist in its atmosphere through <font color="blue">satellites</font>.
Cheered up by this news, biologists in their turn began to do some research to remove people’s puzzles.
Now that there are some suitable conditions, does life really exist on this globe?
Do they multiply by laying eggs, or giving birth to babies?
Last month, a space ship was sent there.
It’s a pity that th<font color="green">is</font> <font color="blue">mission</font> failed.
Unlike the earch, MK-II is a much younger planet.
Thus, masses of harmful acid clouds floa<font color="green">t</font> everywhere, causing <font color="red">viol</font>ent chain reactions to break out.
These clouds not only block<font color="green">ed</font> out the pilot<font color="green">'s'</font> <font color="blue">sight</font>, but also damage<font color="green">d</font> the engine system.

Kuang reached toronto which lies slightly near the border at a <font color="blue">misty dawn</font>.
There was <font color="blue">frost</font> and the <font color="blue">broad</font> downtown streets were very quiet.

<p>Tuan was a farmer in <font color="blue">Vietnam</font>.
For decades, he had been struggling to rid his family of hunger.
However, it always confused him how to expand the output of his crops.
This disturbing problem led to his regretting being a farmer.
He would rather have chosen another job.
One day, when <font color="blue">skimming</font> through a newspaper, Tuan read a comment on Yuan Longping.
He underlined Yuan’s nationality and occup<font color="red">a</font>tion,
and then focused on his discovery and the statistics of his research.
He found the knowledge <font color="blue">Yuan</font> c<font color="red">i</font>rculated very pratical.
Therefore, he made a summ<font color="red">a</font>ry and began to build up a new farming method.
He planted super grain of rich <font color="blue">nutrition</font> and equipped himself to keep his crops <font color="blue">roots</font> free from <font color="blue">bacteria</font> and pests.
He also enriched <font color="blue">minerals in the</font> soil while reducing chemical fert<font color="red">i</font>lizers.
Though it cost him more time and freedom, he was full of hope.
The next year, Tuan was sunburn<font color="green">t</font>, but satisfied with <font color="green">his</font> production very much.
Thanks to Yuan Longping, <font color="blue">he</font> not only <font color="blue">won</font> <font color="blue">the</font> battle against hunger, but he could also <font color="blue">export</font> his crops abroad.</p>

For example, yaw<font color="red">n</font>ing means being not interested, and turning one’s back to someone or swinging your fist shows your anger.
But what those gestures really mean is subjective in different cultures.
Thus, misunderstandings happen now and then in today’s world of cultural crossroads.
Once, representing the adults’ education association, I went to the airport to meet an official of high rank from Columbia and take him to his <font color="red">dormitory</font> and then to the canteen.

<h1 id="22-sightseeing-in-the-united-kingdom">22. Sightseeing in the United Kingdom</h1>

<p>After the wedding, my cousin and his wife went to the united kingdom for nationwide sightseeing.
He faxed a letter to me in English yesterday.
To my delight, he no longer made any tense error, and his description roughly clarified my questions about the UK, its currency, its administr<font color="red">a</font>tion, the institution which devide<font color="green">s</font> <font color="blue">it</font> into four provinces and <font color="green">the</font> historical conflicts and <font color="blue">quarrels</font> when <font color="blue">Southern lreland</font> broke away from the UK.</p>
<font color="blue">Unwilling</font>
<p>to leave out any attraction, my cousin arranged his enjoyable journey carefully.
One attractive place he visited was <font color="green">a</font> castle in the countryside of Scotland which lies near a port.
It used to be the <font color="blue">headquarters</font> of <font color="blue">Communism</font> union, but broke down during the war.
Finding nothing could take the place of this <font color="blue">splendid</font> architecture, people accomplished rebuilding it in 1952.
It was to their credit that all furnished rooms are consist<font color="red">e</font>nt what they used to be.
My cousin was thrilled by its collections consisting of <font color="blue">statues</font> plus royal uniforms <font color="blue">folded in</font> glass <font color="blue">tanks</font>.
Though there was no possibility to buy some of these exhibits,</p>
<font color="blue">it</font>
<p>was conv<font color="red">en</font>inent to take photos which he sent me along with <font color="green">his</font> fax.</p>

My new job left me good impressions in many aspects, expect that the working timetable was full of traveling by jets.
Once, when speeding up, our jet was <font color="blue">swallowed</font> by a thunderstorm,
which destroyed our GPS receiver, and made us lose sight of directions.
A <font color="blue">constantly</font> <font color="blue">flashing light</font> showed that our jet was in danger.
A <font color="blue">steward</font> ins<font color="red">ta</font>ntly asked us to put on masks and fasten the safety belts, and then pressed the button to switch on the escaping capsule.
It <font color="blue">slid</font> sideways out of the opening at once, and landed in the des<font color="red">e</font>rt area safely.
Lacking food and tablets, we were nervous and uncertain at first, but we all kept optimistic and made good adjustment to the situation.

Finally, guided by the smoke of our crashing jet, some local citizens came by carri<font color="red">a</font>ges and saved us.</p>

Little <font color="blue">balloon</font> let out by the thread, fl<font color="green">e</font>w over <font color="blue">cottages</font> and was very glad.

<h1 id="28-lets-help-adolescents">28. Let’s Help <font color="blue">Adolescents</font></h1>

<p>Whether they are male or female, <font color="blue">adolescents</font> feel like deciding on everything themselves in spite of parents’ instruction.
Especially when they face problems like sex, <font color="blue">mental</font> stress, et al, which make them feel <font color="blue">ashamed</font> and embar<font color="red">r</font>assed.
Thus they often automatically get into troubles due to their imperfect comprehension and judg<font color="red">e</font>ment.
Some are <font color="blue">addicted</font> to cigar<font color="red">e</font>ttes.
Only several packets of which will hurt their lungs and make them breathless quickly.
Others can<font color="blue">'t</font> quit drinking alcoho<font color="red">l</font>, whose harmful effects include causing young pr<font color="red">e</font>gn<font color="red">a</font>nt women to <font color="blue">abort</font>, or give birth to abnormal babies.
The worst is drug abuse.
For the <font color="blue">withdrawal</font> is tough once their bodies <font color="blue">are accustomed</font> to the drugs.
Meanwhile, those who share <font color="blue">needles</font> <font color="blue">bought</font> from i<font color="red">l</font>legal ch<font color="red">e</font>mists are <font color="blue">at</font> great risk of being <font color="blue">infected</font> with desp<font color="red">e</font>r<font color="red">a</font>te AIDS.
If so, neither injecting nor taking pills can <font color="red">guarantee</font> their survival.
However, don’t be disappointed <font color="blue">at</font>, or have <font color="blue">prejudice</font> against our children so easily.
After all, being <font color="blue">awkward</font> is <font color="blue">an</font> appendix of <font color="blue">youth</font>.
As long as we strengthen our communication with them, instead of only <font color="blue">banning</font> this or <font color="blue">banning</font> that, we will surely help them avoid anything <font color="blue">unfit</font>.</p>

<h1 id="30-a-volcano-eruption">30. A <font color="red">Volcano</font> Eruption</h1>

<p>As the best candidate, I was appointed to collect an<font color="blue">d</font> evaluate information for <font color="green">a</font> database about diverse natural disasters, such as <font color="blue">hurricanes</font>, typhoons, or thunderstorms.
Sometimes I did this by giving out question<font color="red">n</font>air<font color="red">e</font>s to those who went through them, but sometimes I had to go through actual disasters myself.
The Musaki <font color="red">volcano</font> was one of them.
At that time, I <font color="blue">lived</font> in <font color="blue">a bungalow</font> along side the <font color="red">volcano</font> with a <font color="blue">novelist</font>, who came for the appreciation of its <font color="blue">e</font>ruption.
One day, when I was drawing diagrams on the balcony, and he was <font color="blue">bathing</font> inside, the <font color="red">volcano</font> erupted unexpectedly.
The ash <font color="blue">and</font> lava f<font color="red">o</font>untains shooting highly in th sky varied from fifty to one hund<font color="red">re</font>d meters in height.
It was absolutely fantastic.
I even noticed <font color="blue">a</font> rainbow appear in the <font color="blue">fog</font> caused by heat wave.
But, glancing through our surroundings, I foresaw the potential danger and found no <font color="red">guarantee</font> of our safety.
The uncomfortable gas almost made us uncon<font color="red">s</font>cious.
Sweats of <font color="blue">anxiety</font> began to drop.
Managing to stop <font color="blue">panicking</font> and <font color="blue">trembling</font>, we quickly put on our protective suits, <font color="blue">helmets</font>, and boots, and eventually made our way to a safe place.
How lucky we were, even though my precious equipment and documents were all burnt to the ground.</p>

<p>As a talented <font color="blue">navy</font> officer, he was <font color="blue">bound</font> to be busy.
When his wife rang him up to decl<font color="red">are</font> her <font color="red">divorce</font> alarm, he was still scanning a digital counter to check the data so as to give an ass<font color="red">e</font>sment of the <font color="blue">theoretical</font> framework for a biochemical weapon.
His <font color="blue">junior</font> stuff<font color="blue">'s</font> sympathy made him feel embarrassed.
His wife was a part-time clerk.
With his high bonus, she lived in <font color="green">a</font> grand house with eleg<font color="red">a</font>nt <font color="blue">cushions and</font> bedding.
Her favor was reading stars’ biographies or <font color="blue">absurd fictions</font> with endless chapters in her armchair.
People env<font color="red">i</font>ed her <font color="blue">leisure</font> life very much.
But in fact, she was tired of being left alone.
She sent e-mails to his mailbox every week to state her thinking and asked for his accompan<font color="red">i</font>ment, but never received reply of satisfaction.
Tired of his expl<font color="red">ana</font>tion that he must obey the orders, she <font color="blue">filed</font> for <font color="red">divorce</font>.
Because he desires to get <font color="blue">their holy affection</font> back, he set other affairs aside.
He trimmed his fingernails short, and changed his overweight figure as well as his awful haircut.
He wore an <font color="blue">apron</font> to prepare delicious <font color="blue">cuisine</font> for her.
He also bought her a <font color="blue">necklace</font> and <font color="blue">piles</font> of flowers hoping that <font color="blue">their receiver could</font> turn around.
After being tested out for three month in all, he eventually succeeded.</p>

<p>Mark rented <font color="blue">an accommodation</font> with his pension near the shore.
He paid annual visits there to enjoy the vivid beauty in the depth<font color="green">s</font> of the pure sea.
Once, with his underwater telescope and flashlight, Mark dived along the bound<font color="red">a</font>ry between the steep <font color="blue">reef</font> and the area of seaweed conservation.
Suddenly, an awesome <font color="blue">Antarctic</font> seal with sharp teeth appeared opposite him.
Every cell in his body was scared to death.
But soon he was aware that he wasn’t the target of an attack.
With <font color="green">a</font> <font color="blue">neat</font> wound in its lip caused by a shark, this grey seal was washed upside down <font color="blue">by the tide</font> time after time.
But <font color="blue">it</font> tried to <font color="blue">jog</font> Mark as if to urge him to help it.
So Mark aband<font color="red">o</font>ned <font color="blue">fleeing</font> away.
With its teamwork, Mark used <font color="green">a</font> net to dr<font color="red">a</font>g the seal to the shallow water.
Without pausing, he helped it out after a simple operation and settled it in the narrow cave by the seaside.
Everytime he brought tasty fish, <font color="green">it</font> would <font color="blue">yell</font> and suck his hands happily.</p>

<h1 id="34-helping-the-remote-village">34. Helping the Remote Vill<font color="red">age</font>.</h1>

<p>A year ago, the famous <font color="blue">astronaut</font> received an invitation by airmail from a remote vill<font color="red">age</font>.
Intending to <font color="blue">sniff</font> some fresh air, he and his interp<font color="red">r</font>eter paid a <font color="blue">fortnight</font> visit there.
It was <font color="blue">a privilege</font> for them to be there, but they were shocked by what they saw.
The tracks were mud<font color="red">d</font>y, the river was drying up.
Most vill<font color="red">ager</font>s only <font color="blue">possessed</font> one broom, a few <font color="blue">tins</font>, and several jars,
and their rectangular grass <font color="blue">huts</font> with round angles <font color="blue">were</font> surrounded by weeds.
Besides, their school had no roof and platform.
And the students had no concept of <font color="blue">clicking</font> a computer at all.
They were badly in need.
Soon, the <font color="blue">astronaut</font> made a <font color="red">g</font>enerous voluntary donation to the vill<font color="red">age</font>.
There were textbooks for students, s<font color="red">e</font>wing machines for tailors, and tractors for farmers.
His distribution <font color="blue">catalogue</font> also included operating a clinic and a trunk library as well as giving weekly lessons to teach relevant farming knowledge like how to dry out seeds or raise oxen.
He himself not only help<font color="green">ed</font> to do some paperwork, but also purchase<font color="green">d</font> <font color="blue">grills</font> for boys to <font color="blue">toast</font> potato<font color="red">es</font> and <font color="blue">combs</font> for girls who were dying to get one.
The other day, he heared from the vill<font color="red">ager</font>s again inviting him to participate in the donation <font color="blue">anniversary</font>.
For political and security reasons, he couldn’t ajust his outgoing arr<font color="red">an</font>gement, otherwise he would go.
But his deeds were remembe<font color="red">red</font> forever.</p>

<h1 id="35-study-in-america">35. Study in America</h1>

<p>Nan Nan’ father runs <font color="green">an</font> <font color="blue">enterprise</font> near the <font color="blue">Ming Tombs</font> selling batteries and drills to the Daqing oilfield.
Hoping to get the qualification to help govern <font color="blue">it</font>, Nan Nan made much preparation and then left her motherland with her visa to study in America.
Having reached her destination, she settled in <font color="blue">an inn</font> recommended by the travel ag<font color="red">e</font>nt.
As far as Nan Nan was concerned, she always kept it up in China, but she had to acknowledge it was not easy to adjust herself to the new ac<font color="red">a</font>demic requirements, which were not parallel with China’s.
Though she was occupied with lectures and seminars day in and day out, the <font color="blue">essays</font> she <font color="blue">drafted</font> were still contr<font color="red">a</font>dicted by her <font color="blue">tutors</font>.
As for her <font color="blue">routine</font> life, she <font color="blue">felt that</font> it was hard to fit in, too.
For example, she found English <font color="blue">idioms</font> difficult to understand.
And it was out of the question to eat delicious Chinese food<font color="green">s</font> though many optional cafeteria<font color="green">s</font> served abund<font color="red">a</font>nt substitutes.
In addition, she had to wait in <font color="blue">a queue</font> early for the minibus that took her to school, and it was usually so cold that she felt numb.
What bothered her most was that she received no apology when her sleeping was disturbed by a barking dog in a <font color="blue">shopkeeper's</font> cage.
Luckily, with her parents comforting her <font color="blue">by</font> videophone, she became <font color="blue">autonomous</font> soon and eventually got her bach<font color="red">e</font>lor<font color="green">'s</font> degree successfully.</p>

<h1 id="36-immigrate-to-america">36. <font color="red">Immigrate</font> to America</h1>

<p>Attracted by the boom in America, my nephew <font color="blue">teamed</font> up with <font color="blue">a Korean</font> to illegally cross the <font color="blue">Bering Strait</font> in <font color="green">the</font> Arctic to America.
To avoid the custom’s punishment, they hid in a small <font color="blue">ferry</font> called the north <font color="blue">pole seagull</font>.
Sitting back to back without sleeping, sh<font color="red">o</font>wering, and shaving <font color="blue">for</font> three days, and had no chance to <font color="blue">mourn</font> their <font color="blue">lost</font> l<font color="red">u</font>ggage when landing.
The hard<font color="blue">ship</font> of this crossing was <font color="blue">apparent</font>.
At first, he made a living by means of raising ca<font color="red">tt</font>le, and then was hired in an aircraft <font color="blue">industries</font>.
He lived in <font color="blue">a Catholic</font> district.
Taking in <font color="blue">a</font> small percentage of <font color="blue">Pakistani</font> <font color="blue">immigrants</font>, the majority of the residents were from I<font color="red">t</font>aly and <font color="blue">Denmark</font>, who all kept up their customs and cultures.
Different blocks here were distinctly marked out and indicated from the racial angle.
It was unfair and needed reforming.
But with nowhere else to go, my nephew lived on and managed to make a life for himself.
My nephew’s fortune came when he bravely helped a conductor <font color="blue">brake</font> a tram to stop it from <font color="blue">slipping</font> out of the <font color="blue">rails</font>.
The man was elected <font color="blue">vice</font> chairman of the socialist party later.
It occur<font color="red">r</font>ed my nephew that he could grasp this oppo<font color="red">r</font>tunity to ask for his help.
The man who was thankful helped him apply to the civil authority for the right <font color="blue">to live in</font> in America by inserting his brave deed into his documents.
Unlike a great many other applicants, his application was approved by the <font color="blue">federal</font> justice ministry.
Before long, he started his own <font color="blue">bakery</font> and lived a better life.</p>

<h1 id="37-be-careful-about-cloning">37. Be Careful about Cloning</h1>

<p>After a series of initial experiments and corrections, the scientist’s hard work paid off when the twin clone turke<font color="green">y</font>s were hatched with normal feather and <font color="blue">claws</font>.
This breakthrough possibily enabled people to bring their <font color="blue">adored</font> pets back to life.
However, it bothered him from time to time that their health was in poor condition because they were unable to resist illnesses.

Shortly afterwards, the media published a conservative argument objecting to cloning owing to moral problems, and suggested the constitution include <font color="blue">compulsory</font> regulations to forbid obtaining commercial profits <font color="blue">from</font> cloning.
When interviewed, the scientist stared <font color="blue">at</font> the decorations on the ceiling, thinking for a while, and then said,

<h1 id="38-strange-patent-applications">38. Strange Patent Applications</h1>

<p>I set about working in the current patent office after resigning from <font color="blue">the court personnel</font>.
Competent and dynamic, I never feel passive while diving into the identifications of whether applications are valid and practical according to the new version of the <font color="blue">criteria</font>.
With the expectation of distinguishing their own importance, some people leave the <font color="blue">beaten</font> track, and <font color="blue">file</font> strange products with us now and then.
For example, <font color="blue">lantern that</font> can be attached on your forehead, cubic <font color="blue">walnuts</font>, <font color="red">refrigerator</font> made of <font color="blue">straw</font> and glue, perfume that nobody can bear to smile, and so on.
Once, a man made a triangle helicopter out of <font color="blue">stainless</font> wires and string.
He called us up, and <font color="blue">merrily</font> claimed that it was <font color="blue">stable</font> and <font color="red">convinent</font> to use, and never out of order.
I asked him to hang on, but this <font color="blue">innocent</font> man just <font color="blue">rang</font> off and set out to fly from his <font color="blue">courtyard</font>.
I <font color="blue">dialed</font> his number <font color="blue">in the</font> direct<font color="red">o</font>ry trying to ring him back, but never got through.
Merc<font color="red">i</font>ful God blessing, <font color="blue">an abrupt freezing</font> rainfall made his <font color="blue">powder</font> wet.
Luckily, the trouble was without any exten<font color="red">s</font>ion except that he crashed into a <font color="blue">greengrocer's</font>, making all the ripe fruits become messy jam.
When people <font color="blue">seized</font> this crasy man with caution, and sobered him by tapping his face, he complained about the bad weather, instead of associating his failure with his unscientific design.</p>

<h1 id="39-pronunciation-and-status">39. Pro<font color="red">nun</font>ciation and Status</h1>

<p>An <font color="blue">ambassador</font> and <font color="blue">a referee</font> were consulting a professor on <font color="blue">the</font> caption of <font color="blue">a Buddhistic</font> alphabet,
when a sobbing woman stopped them to sell <font color="blue">an antique</font> musi<font color="red">cal</font> <font color="blue">bathtub</font>.
Her dirty <font color="blue">garment</font> <font color="blue">and</font> the <font color="blue">handkerchief</font> around her <font color="blue">waist</font> were badly in need of senting to a laundry.
The <font color="blue">ambassador</font> uncomfortably gave her a handful of <font color="blue">pence</font> from his wallet and said,
‘Take this fortune away, troublesome woman.’
When her <font color="blue">figure</font> faded away, the brill<font color="red">ia</font>nt professor said,
‘You <font color="blue">are</font> mistaken <font color="blue">and your</font> inproper remake on her should be cond<font color="red">e</font>mned.
In terms of this extr<font color="red">aor</font>dinary woman, you can’t classify her status by her horrible cloth<font color="green">es</font> or disgusting nails.</p>
<font color="blue">Her</font>
<p>clean woolen <font color="blue">vest</font> and <font color="blue">stocking</font>, esp<font color="red">e</font>cially her classic pronunciation, all suggested her upper status.’
The <font color="blue">ambassador</font> gave a w<font color="red">h</font>istle in amazement, and <font color="blue">advised</font> making her <font color="blue">acquaintance</font>.
The professor hesitated for a while, then compromised.
The outcome was that she was an <font color="blue">authentic</font> superior police officer.
When they were shown in her office and saw her once more, she brought them a <font color="blue">teapot</font> of tea and some cookies, laughing and saying,
‘I <font color="blue">rubbed</font> some cream <font color="blue">and wax on</font> my garment, and pass<font color="green">ed</font> myself off as a shabby woman among thie<font color="green">ve</font>s and robbers to investigate a plot.
Generally speaking, you<font color="green">r</font> overloooking me <font color="blue">and</font> my adaptation are <font color="blue">the</font> best help, but my pronunciation seemed to have <font color="blue">betrayed</font> me.’</p>

<h1 id="40-a-sly-murder">40. A <font color="blue">Sly</font> Murder</h1>

<p>When giving a lecture about the significance <font color="blue">of punctuation</font>,
the ac<font color="red">a</font>demic professor was inter<font color="red">r</font>upted and <font color="red">ar</font>rested by the police for murdering his wife, a receptionist of <font color="blue">a kindergarten</font>.
The police found some photos he deleted from the E-<font color="blue">album</font> showing that <font color="green">they</font> used have a gay life.
But, fed up with her <font color="blue">wrinkled</font> face, he murdered her instead of <font color="red">divorc</font>ing her to avoid <font color="red">for</font>tune devision.
He cut up a kind of seashell with a sharpen<font color="red">ed</font> knife and ha<font color="red">m</font>mered it into <font color="blue">powder</font> on a <font color="blue">skateboard</font>,
and made at most one gram which was enough to accelerate one’s <font color="blue">pulse</font> until he or she dies.
This kind of poison can date back to 10000 BC when people rubbed it on spears to kill beasts.
The professor <font color="blue">mixed</font> the poison with onion, waterm<font color="red">e</font>lon, and yog<font color="red">u</font>rt for his wife.</p>
<font color="blue">Howling</font>
<p>and <font color="blue">scratching</font> her chest, she felt dizzy and died soon.
After <font color="blue">tentative</font> examination, the police assume<font color="green">d</font> she died of <font color="blue">heart</font> disease.
But <font color="blue">systematic botanical analyses</font> show<font color="green">ed</font> that the waterm<font color="red">e</font>lon spit on the m<font color="red">e</font>ssy <font color="blue">mat and the quilt</font> was poison<font color="red">ous</font>.
Regradless of exhaustion and starv<font color="red">a</font>tion, the acute and skillful policeman use<font color="green">d</font> radioactive equipment to make sure the category of the poison.</p>
<font color="blue">Primitive</font>
<p>and not ample as their <font color="blue">alternative</font> equipment was,
they got perfect accuracy somehow.
People <font color="blue">applauded</font> the police and the woman’s family can look ahead with relief now.</p>
